# MISC PSX Code from that PS1 programming course

## Build

### Install `just`
`cargo install just` or grab it from the the [repo](https://github.com/casey/just)

### Run the build task
`just b <target>` where `<target>` is the name of the .s file without the extension

### Load up the resulting .ps-exe file in an emulator
I recommend [PCSX-Redux](https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux), but you do you.
